Some can't work with other decorations, while many of them can be combined into one card.\n\n**Features**\nNow take time to look at the different types of decorations. Review closely the following three canvases to see the different decorations and how they can be used.\n- [[Borders.canvas|Borders]]\n- [[Cards.canvas|Cards]]\n- [[Headers and Labels.canvas|Headers and Labels]]\n- [[Features/Stickers.canvas|Stickers]]\n\n**Stencils**\nAdditionally, a number of stencils are provided in this vault. These stencils make it convenient to get to frequently needed pre-made cards with various decorations. Review each of these stencils closely. Remember, when you start using Canvas Candy, these stencils make it easy to copy from them useful predefined cards with decorations and paste them into your own canvas.\n\n\n![[02 Stencil Index]]\n","id":"bf49d750b67006da","x":-540,"y":-340,"width":700,"height":1060},
