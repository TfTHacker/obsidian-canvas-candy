A cssclasses is made up of a few elements. As shown in the previous example, we were using the following callout:\n\n```\n---\ncssclasses:\n  - cc-border-double\n---\n```\n\nWhich produced the following result in a card:","id":"5eb4b462197c26fd","x":-560,"y":-560,"width":680,"height":360},

You will see its contents have the cssclasses with the command `cc-border-double`. This tells Obsidian to change the normal thick line border into double lines.\n\nThis is the secret sauce: these special cssclasses are decorating the card, but are not visible unless you are editing the card.\n\nNotice that the following card also has double lines, but has text in it. Go ahead and double-click on the card to see its contents. ","id":"7526699335c2bf5a","x":-560,"y":-190,"width":385,"height":420}
