These changes are all called decorations. Notice the following cards:","id":"8d752114bfd575f3","x":-1646,"y":-1460,"width":666,"height":80},

Card 2 is the same shape, but has a decoration added to give it a double-line border. Card 3 and Card 4 also have different decorations, dashed and dotted borders.\n#### What is a decoration?\nA decoration is like a command that tells Obsidian to transform a card to appear in differently. You might think of a decoration like a real item you might use in your house to make it look nicer and more like home. You can add a decoration or multiple decorations to a card to change how it appears.\n\nCanvas Candy uses Obsidian cssclasses and callouts with unique names as a way for us to define the type of decoration. If you are unfamiliar with cssclasses or callouts in Obsidian, we recommend you stop this tutorial and read about them in:\n\n- [cssclasses properties](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties#Property+format)\n- [Callouts](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts). \n\nFor the remainder of this tutorial, we assume you know how to use cssclass and callouts. Just remember, you can only use Canvas Candy with cssclasses and callouts. Returning to our previous examples, if you click on Card 1, you'll see it is empty, it has no contents. However, Card 2 contains the following text:\n\n```\n---\n\ncssclasses:\n  - cc-border-double\n---\n\n```\n\n","id":"d76f268c4f7efdc9","x":-1646,"y":-1200,"width":726,"height":545},
